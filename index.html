						<h2> About the summer school </h2>

						<p>After the success of the online summer schools, the <span style = "font-weight: bold"> Summer School in Experimental, Methodological and Computational Design in Psychology</span> organised jointly by UCL and PKU returns. The school will provide high-quality training for talented and motivated students while facilitating and strengthening collaboration between UCL & PKU.</p>

						<p>With an explicit focus on high-quality research, this course provides training in a range of experimental psychology research methods. These include big data and data mining approaches, developmental neuroimaging and longitudinal methods, and other methods used in diverse fields of psychology such as computational psychiatry, perceptual and value-based decision making, and social cognition. Topics will be taught by expert faculty members from UCL and PKU, offering students a high-quality education and an opportunity to interact with world-leading researchers and a cohort of similarly motivated and talented peers.</p>

						<p> The school will be hosted by UCL and will occur <span style = "font-weight: bold">8-12 July 2024 in London</span>, and we welcome applications from postgraduate and exceptional undergraduate students from both UCL and PKU.</p>

						<p> <span style = "font-weight: bold">Applications for this year are now open.</span></p>
						
						<p>The summer school is jointly funded by UCL and PKU.</p>
